Unfortunately this school allows the pressure of scores passing the anxiety to the kids to get good results for FSA test; its not acceptable, but the school doesn't care, all they care is about the rating, and the PTA works so hard to collect donation that its annoying, shame on the principal of this schools that sends voice messages to the parents even on Sundays at 8pm asking for donations. 98% of the communication from the school is to ask for money, and none about your children learning concerns. So disappointed of this school. Hopefully they will get a new principal that will care about a safe learning environment rather that the rating.\",\n",

       "       'review': \"Forest Trail Academy is the best online school I've ever seen! My son Michael is currently finishing 5th grade and we plan to continue studying at this school further. We are Israelis, so English is a foreign language for my son. My son goes to a regular Israeli school and is additionally studying at the FTA. However, even the most difficult subject for him - Language Arts - lends itself very well to study. The curriculum for all courses, including Math, Social Studies and Science, is very rich and interesting for the student. A very large amount of information on all courses is ideally combined with an excellent, interesting and accessible presentation for the child. My son received a lot of knowledge, and at the same time experienced great pleasure in performing experiments and making various crafts and presentations. I would like to note the very high professionalism of all teachers, especially Ms. Emeline Briley and Ms. Amanda Swan. These teachers are truly dedicated to their work, and have a professional, individual approach to the needs of each student. The school website has a very simple interface that is understandable for both students and their parents. When there are minor problems (for example, a link does not work), then the FTA staff fix it very quickly. I hope that in the future, online video lessons with the participation of teachers and students (at least partially, 1-2 lessons per week) will be added to the curriculum for greater immersion of the child in the learning environment. Thank you very much, Forest Trail Academy, for the excellent teaching of my son!\",\n",

They have had several issues with staff and there has been some turnover but all the change has been for the better of the school. My biggest complaint is the carpool inefficiency, I know there are more effective efficient ways of doing carpool. Also at times drop off in the morning has been difficult, I have two kids going there and sometimes a child is in the back seat of my van if anyone slows down the line in the morning everyone gets upset. But there have been threats from the principal to not allow parents to walk their children in. Sometimes they have cones up making it difficult to get in the lane dedicated for those that need to park and walk their kids in. It sometimes feels like we get contradictory messages; \"keep carpool moving don\\'t walk in your children\", or \"don\\'t be tardy, don\\'t hurry carpool by walking your child in\". Their best solution is get their 10 min early, which would be nice but even on our best days we struggle. With no bus system I expect more understanding from the staff.I have friends that are in the safety patrol and they are upset that their yearly trip price almost doubled after they\\'d already made a down payment. And, many of their fundraisers have been turned down. I guess some safety patrol kids dropped out of the trip and raised the price for everyone. I do wish my second grader was tested on coming in this fall as a homeschooler and put in an accelerated program, I don\\'t think he\\'s being challenged. But he\\'s happy and loves his teacher. My fifth grade son is going through puberty mood swings so I don\\'t think it is the school\\'s fault, he regularly says he hates school. But he is definitely being challenged and has some good education going on. In part thanks to staff changes. The staff seemed so happy when registering us but when we see them at carpool they are often upset or cordial, but to their defense there are some awful parents there. Sometimes Charter schools attract parents that are less than pleasant.My only other thing I wish could be changed is the incessant requests for money. The after school special programs are cool and my kids want to do them but the costs add up for a parent not used to paying for after care and not needing it. The peer pressure to participate is so strong.',\n",

I had the same teacher for 2nd and 3rd grade and she did not challenge me at all. I was frequently bored in class and had nothing to do. My mother complained to the principal who told her that it was okay to have an average child and that I wasn't smart enough to be moved up. Fourth and fith grade were much improved considering my mother forced my 3rd grade teacher to put me in advanced. I didn't really like any kid there and I am glad I don't have any contact with any of them anymore. Make what you will of my story when thinking about this school.\",\n",

Every snack that was given to him from home was inspected for sugar and teacher was telling the boy that if it was bought in a cookie aisle, it\\'s not aloud; even though it was just a fig bar with sugar content less than in one banana.On the other side, teacher avoided any communication with me, parent. My notes in the agenda were left unsigned and unanswered. Some questions from children during the class was answered:\"Oops, you missed it.\" or \"Figure it out yourself.\" Trying to make an appointment with the school Principal became an impossible task. I don\\'t know why my son was singled out by Mrs.Greene but I am glad we are out of this school.',\n",

School gave her 'how to make friends' training and while leaving school she was confident, academically good and happy kid with good no of friends. I like this school for my daughter. Only thing bothered me was too many fund raising (optional) events but we didn't participate in many. I don't mind giving money directly to school so school should consider that option too.

The transition to middle school was made much easier by the teachers and staff and we were very happy with the results. The teachers do care about the students and it is very clear that they motivate the students to excel. Our son has excelled in his studies and the year has been very much a success. Sure, there are some problem students like in any other school, but the administration seems to handle these situations in a manner that lets other students understand that these types of situations will not be acceptable. The kids for the most part feel safe and supported in this environment and feel good about learning. So far, our experience with Polo Park has been nothing but positive!',\n",

Polo had some of the best testing scores im the region back then, then there was a huge boom in students that didn't care about school. When Latson left, Blake changed everything, made the school have stricter policies and what not, then Clark came and she just screwed everything up in my opinion (and most of the other 8th graders as well). As for the teachers most were pretty good but there were some bad ones as well. Shout out to Mrs.Garcia and Mrs. Williams you helped prepare me for the rigoriorous math courses at Suncoast. Also to Mr. Theroux, Mr.Shelager and Mrs. beach. Students, if you see any of these teachers on your schedule then you should be grateful, they are the school's best and they will prepare you for any high school. Now just one more question, is Mr. Abel still there?\",\n",

With this first hand experience we wonder if some of the earlier comments/ posts actually refers to another school ? What we have found are great teachers and a truly diverse group of seemingly happy kids and parents that care. No bullying which was a major issue up north.

Some people say the bulling is all outside the school but the truth is the teachers never pay attention to whats going on in classes, in the cafeteria, in the halls and on the bus. Teachers should try to be less ignorant and pay attention to what is always going on. One last thing is that the age groups should not be mixed. lots of older kids take advantage of the younger ones and it results in bulling which again teachers dont notice. I am at a new school now and i love it. There is not a lot of bulling and if there is any the teachers are very strict about it and solve the problem right away.

       "       'review': \"Forest Trail Academy is the best online school I've ever seen! My son Michael is currently finishing 5th grade and we plan to continue studying at this school further. We are Israelis, so English is a foreign language for my son. My son goes to a regular Israeli school and is additionally studying at the FTA. However, even the most difficult subject for him - Language Arts - lends itself very well to study. The curriculum for all courses, including Math, Social Studies and Science, is very rich and interesting for the student. A very large amount of information on all courses is ideally combined with an excellent, interesting and accessible presentation for the child. My son received a lot of knowledge, and at the same time experienced great pleasure in performing experiments and making various crafts and presentations. I would like to note the very high professionalism of all teachers, especially Ms. Emeline Briley and Ms. Amanda Swan. These teachers are truly dedicated to their work, and have a professional, individual approach to the needs of each student. The school website has a very simple interface that is understandable for both students and their parents. When there are minor problems (for example, a link does not work), then the FTA staff fix it very quickly. I hope that in the future, online video lessons with the participation of teachers and students (at least partially, 1-2 lessons per week) will be added to the curriculum for greater immersion of the child in the learning environment. Thank you very much, Forest Trail Academy, for the excellent teaching of my son!\",\n",

       "       'review': 'I think the faculty at this school are doing the best they can. They have had several issues with staff and there has been some turnover but all the change has been for the better of the school. My biggest complaint is the carpool inefficiency, I know there are more effective efficient ways of doing carpool. Also at times drop off in the morning has been difficult, I have two kids going there and sometimes a child is in the back seat of my van if anyone slows down the line in the morning everyone gets upset. But there have been threats from the principal to not allow parents to walk their children in. Sometimes they have cones up making it difficult to get in the lane dedicated for those that need to park and walk their kids in. It sometimes feels like we get contradictory messages; \"keep carpool moving don\\'t walk in your children\", or \"don\\'t be tardy, don\\'t hurry carpool by walking your child in\". Their best solution is get their 10 min early, which would be nice but even on our best days we struggle. With no bus system I expect more understanding from the staff.I have friends that are in the safety patrol and they are upset that their yearly trip price almost doubled after they\\'d already made a down payment. And, many of their fundraisers have been turned down. I guess some safety patrol kids dropped out of the trip and raised the price for everyone. I do wish my second grader was tested on coming in this fall as a homeschooler and put in an accelerated program, I don\\'t think he\\'s being challenged. But he\\'s happy and loves his teacher. My fifth grade son is going through puberty mood swings so I don\\'t think it is the school\\'s fault, he regularly says he hates school. But he is definitely being challenged and has some good education going on. In part thanks to staff changes. The staff seemed so happy when registering us but when we see them at carpool they are often upset or cordial, but to their defense there are some awful parents there. Sometimes Charter schools attract parents that are less than pleasant.My only other thing I wish could be changed is the incessant requests for money. The after school special programs are cool and my kids want to do them but the costs add up for a parent not used to paying for after care and not needing it. The peer pressure to participate is so strong.',\n",

       "       'review': \"My daughter started here in 6th grade. We had high expectations because we loved Equestrian Trails right next door and since they're in close proximity we figured they'd be somewhat similar. What we found was teachers that didn't want to teach the first year. We dealt with it figuring MS was different from elementary. Second year, out of all of her teachers, again, one sub par teacher. 8th grade came and we truly saw a pattern. She had a science teacher showing the class baby bunnies being skinned. I had to sign a permission slip for my daughter to watch Titanic in 6th or 7th yet, this didn't warrant the same? My daughter loves animals (as do we, her parents), so, this did not sit well. This teacher is well known in the parental and fellow teaching community to be incompetent. In addition, the school is also bad with handling situations. As long as your child doesn't run into any issues here, I guess I could see how you'd consider it an okay school. Unfortunately, we had an issue. All they wanted to do was sweep it under the rug. There was no formal process at all. I wouldn't send my dog there. Hoping the incoming new Principal changes things drastically.\",\n",

       "       'review': \"Well, I must say my son attended this school and he was never the same. Although the teachers in the core classes were excellent, the school itself had big problems. First, the policy of a zero or 50% for missed homework is terrible. It is inconsistent and it promotes a feeling of failure for the kids. - to fail kids for missed homework is counterproductive. A policy to promote learning should be used--maybe assign double homework if missed.. Second, there is no real partnership or attempt at partnership with parents. There is no strict rules on upgrading edline, and many teachers don't even post homework.. For these kids, it's all new to have 7 classes, and 7 teachers, and keep an agenda etc. but there is little support. Second, PE is a disaster at this school. I recommend everyone to opt out of PE. It's a Mess with 60 plus kids with sometimes much more from all grades combined. Half the kids sit around because they can't even participate since there are too many kids. The kids at this school are rude to teachers to a shocking degree. The policy of no uniforms is a bad one for this age group as it promotes bully issues. Overall great teachers,but bad atmosphere\",\n",

       "       'review': \"Look, middle school is a tough age for parents, kids, and teachers alike. This school does its best to avoid conflict among students- staggering each grade level bell schedule to avoid conflict during class changes. Although I do feel the academics are a bit lackluster, all the teachers I've encountered here are very vocal and forward and will contact you if your child isn't doing well or they miss assignments. Overall I am overall happy with the instruction my kid receives there. During COVID they have painted and cleaned up many areas of the school while students have been away. The principals and administration are very responsive and proactive and they address problems that parents bring to their attention almost immediately. Bullying happens as it does in every school, but there is a no tolerance policy and no pointless 'peace po-wows'- students are separated, given detention, or suspended for any involvement in fights. (My child was given detention for filming / encouraging a fight- and never it did that again after.) There are a number of programs and electives available to students: Cambridge (Accelerated/Honors), Culinary, IT & Pre-Med. Any student can take IT or the medical courses as an elective (you don't have to be in the program.) I live in the surrounding neighborhood and expected a lot more shenanigans from kids going to school and leaving in the afternoon... With that said, the basketball courts and track are open in the morning and in the afternoon give the student a safe place to hang out. All in all it's a decent school.\",\n",

But when you actually get into reality and the social medias these kids are put into, you have to expect some conflict between kids when touched with some sensitive topics. The sports here are extremely good, your kids won't have a hard time making friends, the teachers are strict and do get fed up a bit and give everyone the normal talking but that's to give you a better behavior and attitude and academic skill. All in all it's a good school, some kids in here have slight anger issues and just simply want to pick a fight so just stay with your trustworthy group of friends and you won't be bothered. And if you have good grades (like me not speaking self conceitedly) you will definitely get along with the teachers -incoming 6th grader with past siblings that had gone to woodlands :))\",\n",

There has been a strict dress code which we\\'ve found to be a positive however this year the dress code relaxed somewhat with the students being able to hang shirt outside their shorts and increased color choices, of which I have not been a fan. We have not heard of any bullying at the school and only of one incident with 2 boys on the bus. An improvement to the interior grounds, especially the inner courtyard, by planting shrubs / tree\\'s etc. is needed as is unattractive.

       "       'review': \"Forest Trail Academy is the best online school I've ever seen! My son Michael is currently finishing 5th grade and we plan to continue studying at this school further. We are Israelis, so English is a foreign language for my son. My son goes to a regular Israeli school and is additionally studying at the FTA. However, even the most difficult subject for him - Language Arts - lends itself very well to study. The curriculum for all courses, including Math, Social Studies and Science, is very rich and interesting for the student. A very large amount of information on all courses is ideally combined with an excellent, interesting and accessible presentation for the child. My son received a lot of knowledge, and at the same time experienced great pleasure in performing experiments and making various crafts and presentations. I would like to note the very high professionalism of all teachers, especially Ms. Emeline Briley and Ms. Amanda Swan. These teachers are truly dedicated to their work, and have a professional, individual approach to the needs of each student. The school website has a very simple interface that is understandable for both students and their parents. When there are minor problems (for example, a link does not work), then the FTA staff fix it very quickly. I hope that in the future, online video lessons with the participation of teachers and students (at least partially, 1-2 lessons per week) will be added to the curriculum for greater immersion of the child in the learning environment. Thank you very much, Forest Trail Academy, for the excellent teaching of my son!\",\n",

On the positive, the AICE program seems to be good and overall the kids seem to be nice.On the negative, my child, who is very quiet and respectful, is often times verbally abused by the staff and teachers. Also, the band booster, which is parent run, is terrible. The moms who appoint themselves as the leaders are very cliquish and are downright mean. I tried to help out by volunteering and had to endure offensive remarks and often times was just plain ignored, like a scene right out of the movie mean girls. This is a very shocking thing to experience from adults, which is a shame because the kids in band all seem very nice. It’s no wonder more than half the parents do not pay the fair share.',\n",

       "       'review': \"Regular classes are a complete joke. You don't even need to study or even pay attention in class to earn an A. In 9th grade I had to take all regular classes except one, and let me say it was a total waste of my time. I would have graduated with many more rewards and credits than I got if I wasn't forced to take the regular ones the first year. Classes are so easy that my 1st year I barely spoke English, yet passed all my classes with better marks than your average WHS kid. The next year I was still below average in my communication in English, yet again, I have passed my AICE classes. Same goes for the rest of the next 2 years. The school is completely ran down -- ----, bathroom stall broken hinges, sinks that don't even work properly, vandalized bathroom doors, paint peeling off, etc. The teachers are given no authority at all unfortunately. They are constantly given attitude by kids, talked smack about, asked questions they shouldn't even be asked, yelled at, oppressed, everything along those lines. Teachers should in no way be treated that way, and it disgusts me. It was heartbreaking and unpleasant to witness the majority of classes being like that. The school has no discipline. As for the staff, endless times they have made mistakes, which is okay. However, they never bothered to solve the issue themselves, and always blamed it on me. In the end, it had to be me who had to take responsibility and the consequences for their mistakes, and just shut my mouth because even if i spoke up, I'd be ignored. And let me clarify that I was by far the only student to whom that sort of thing has happened to. The food from the cafeteria shouldn't even be called food. It's so bad, that all you end up eating are bags of chips or a handful of cookies to ease the hunger.- A student\",\n",

After only attending wellington for two years i feel that this is where i received the best education. The teachers were always very helpful and had no problem explaining things again or helping you after class. The sports programs are outstanding and create a sense of great friendship with your teammates and your entire school. The spirit of the school at pep rallies is something that i will remember forever. This is truly a great school.',\n",

They didnt have enough coverage and the Aide left a Subsitute with 5 adults with Autism alone while he went to eat lunch. The other student was agitated when he switches classes and ended up assulting my son. The parents has never even had her son appologize.The school has never paid the hospitle bills even though they said they would. I spent 4 hours in the ER with my son getting a MRI to make sure he didnt have any head injuries. They never even called an ambulance for my son. It took 45 mins and the ER nurse and myself to stop the bleeding from his nose which had deep gashes on it and now scarring as a result. My son had night terrors for over 2 weeks straight and wouldnt lay down unless we were with him.my son is 19 years old and wasent talking in a full sentence. I have pulled him out and put him in another school specificly for Autism. He talked in full sentences 3 days after starting there. terrible school I am glad we are out of there.

       "       'review': 'My son has attended WCS since Kindergarten, he is now a Senior. I cannot say enough about WCS. The elementary program is wonderful, nurturing, and prepares the students well beyond their years.The MS and HS just get better. The teachers are incredible--and take a personal mentoring interest in each and every student. I was always against accelerated learning (thinking kids should be kids) but the WCS curriculum moves the kids through at a very natural pace, presenting a range of Hnors and AP courses and preparing them above and beyond for the very competitive college entry and world they will face. For both students and parents that want to be involved, WCS offers a wide range of extracurricular activities (sports, fine arts, clubs). While it may not have everything a school with thousands of students offers-- the trade off is that you children, whether K2 to 12th grade will receive individual attention. Parents know parents, teachers/ faculty/ staff know the kids, and parents know the other kids. It is a very close knit community of families where the kids receive an excellent education and are offered many opportunities to grow.',\n",

My youngest started at the school in pre-school and we have been very happy with the school over the last 11 years. We chose the school because of their accelerated academic program within a Christian atmosphere. The teachers have always been excellent in engaging the students, making learning fun, and actually caring about the children. The school cares about the kids learning the material, instead of teaching to any standardized test ( my children, though, have consistently scored above the 90th percentile on national standardized testing). My children will be entering college very well prepared, confident, well-rounded young men. They as students, and we as parents have truly been blessed to be a part of this excellent school!',\n",

There are different rules for children at this school depending on monetary donations. I sent my child to this school for the christian teaching you cannot get in a public school, however they do not act very Christian like. I liked the chapel and Bible stories, but too bad some children are outcasts for not being perfect. This school does not seem to be able to handle children as well as they advertise. There is bullying at this school and is ignored for some children. This may be due to some teachers not being licensed by the state of Florida. For the amount of money you pay for an education I think you at least deserve licensed teachers and staff. I would advise all parents to check on The Florida Department Of Education website. I should have realized there was a problem with this school when there was only an assistant principal for the entire school year. A teacher from the school stepped up to take the position for the upcoming school year. My child was in elementary. My child is enrolled in another school for camp and has been happy and I have been told he is a pleasure!',\n",

I once felt my bank had too many ridiculous unnecessary fees until I sent my child to WCS. With the cost of this school s tuition in addition to the many wonderful exciting opportunities they offer (for a fee of course) one would think they could at least afford better fold up chairs for parents to sit in when attending school plays or attending school meetings to hear all about the new fees coming. I thought this school was going to provide my child with a better foundation/introduction into the school world however after my child s experience at WCS (which involved bullying) I would not send my child here ever again even for free. Rating this school with one star is more than I'd like to give, 1/5th of a star is what's deserved (for the good parking spots they have) but I think more and more parking spaces will become available as parents stop sending their kids there. I'm one of five that will not be re-enrolling this year (that I know of).\",\n",

This was my youngest son’s first year in Kindergarten, with the Covid-19 outbreak there were so many uncertainties and fears to face entering the school year but his teachers Mrs. Lufbery and Mrs. Cooney and the whole staff at PRE were OUTSTANDING!! They really paved the way for a very successful, bright future for my son. I’m forever grateful and highly recommend this school.',\n",

Unfortunately this school allows the pressure of scores passing the anxiety to the kids to get good results for FSA test; its not acceptable, but the school doesn't care, all they care is about the rating, and the PTA works so hard to collect donation that its annoying, shame on the principal of this schools that sends voice messages to the parents even on Sundays at 8pm asking for donations. 98% of the communication from the school is to ask for money, and none about your children learning concerns. So disappointed of this school. Hopefully they will get a new principal that will care about a safe learning environment rather that the rating.\",\n",

Sure, there are some problem students like in any other school, but the administration seems to handle these situations in a manner that lets other students understand that these types of situations will not be acceptable.

Polo had some of the best testing scores im the region back then, then there was a huge boom in students that didn't care about school. When Latson left, Blake changed everything, made the school have stricter policies and what not, then Clark came and she just screwed everything up in my opinion (and most of the other 8th graders as well). As for the teachers most were pretty good but there were some bad ones as well. Shout out to Mrs.Garcia and Mrs. Williams you helped prepare me for the rigoriorous math courses at Suncoast. Also to Mr. Theroux, Mr.Shelager and Mrs. beach. Students, if you see any of these teachers on your schedule then you should be grateful, they are the school's best and they will prepare you for any high school. Now just one more question, is Mr. Abel still there?\",\n",

       "       'review': 'I have been at this school since 6th grade and I cannot say much about this school. Sure the teachers are nice and some of the students but there is no control or organization. The teachers do not have control over the students and some classes have gotten to be a disaster, and we dont get the required learning. Some people say the bulling is all outside the school but the truth is the teachers never pay attention to whats going on in classes, in the cafeteria, in the halls and on the bus. Teachers should try to be less ignorant and pay attention to what is always going on. One last thing is that the age groups should not be mixed. lots of older kids take advantage of the younger ones and it results in bulling which again teachers dont notice. I am at a new school now and i love it. There is not a lot of bulling and if there is any the teachers are very strict about it and solve the problem right away. The counselor is constantly talking to us about bulling and how to prevent it and why.',\n",

I had some amazing teachers that helped shape my life - specifically Mrs. Bretherick who taught me that if you want to do well you have to challenge yourself. Her class was not easy and I was glad for it, as it helped me not only with college, but with life beyond that. Mr. LaFevers taught me the true meaning of compassion and giving. Mr. Hall taught me that no matter how big my dream was, it was attainable as long as I was willing to work towards it. Mr. O'Hara was a great teacher always willing to help if you showed an effort. He brightened my days with his quirky personality and love for science. The office staff and teachers were always willing to help when needed. True, the time between classes could have been a bit longer since the campus is so large, but if you're not socializing you can get to class on time. The clubs and activities are extensive and fun. The cafeteria has some of the best school food I've ever eaten with tons of varieties.\",\n",

Most times, needing to make a stop at your locker to pick up your textbook. Not Because you need it to learn, but because you receive a detention for not bringing it. A second late to class, detention. No exceptions. It is impossible to have a stress free day in this mess. Go to John I. Having gone a year to both schools, John I. by far exceeded expectations. Each and every student is cared for, and not treated rudely the way they would be in pbc. John I. Made me feel like I was important, cared for. They have even referred me to the school therapist to speak one on one. Many of the AP's at John I. Made full effort to help me, while pbc makes me feel as if I am constantly and only ever being watched for mistakes. Don't do this to yourself. Leave it for students who are perfect, because they are the only ones left alone.\",\n",

We question this so we know if its a problem with him not doing work, or if he needs a tudor.

Unfortunately this school allows the pressure of scores passing the anxiety to the kids to get good results for FSA test; its not acceptable, but the school doesn't care, all they care is about the rating, and the PTA works so hard to collect donation that its annoying, shame on the principal of this schools that sends voice messages to the parents even on Sundays at 8pm asking for donations. 98% of the communication from the school is to ask for money, and none about your children learning concerns. So disappointed of this school. Hopefully they will get a new principal that will care about a safe learning environment rather that the rating.\",\n",

Once again, with your child's best interest at hand, look elsewhere.\",\n",

They had two teachers Mrs. Moore in the morning was great and the afternoon teacher was horrible and my kid didn't learn anything in the afternoon. the afternoon teacher had no patience. So glad we are out of there. I was very disappointed and so were many other parents. Some people should not be teachers. We had to get our kid extra help to get caught up because the teacher in the afternoon did not do her job. Binks Elementary and Wellington have better teachers in vpk that care and take the time out not only for the students but for the parents also.\",\n",

Polo had some of the best testing scores im the region back then, then there was a huge boom in students that didn't care about school. When Latson left, Blake changed everything, made the school have stricter policies and what not, then Clark came and she just screwed everything up in my opinion (and most of the other 8th graders as well). As for the teachers most were pretty good but there were some bad ones as well. Shout out to Mrs.Garcia and Mrs. Williams you helped prepare me for the rigoriorous math courses at Suncoast. Also to Mr. Theroux, Mr.Shelager and Mrs. beach. Students, if you see any of these teachers on your schedule then you should be grateful, they are the school's best and they will prepare you for any high school. Now just one more question, is Mr. Abel still there?\",\n",

We moved down to Wellington from NY and I have to admit that I was a bit concerned after reading some of the posts on this site - and others. We decided to give it a try anyways. I can honestly say that we really like pretty much everything about Polo Park after the first year. With this first hand experience we wonder if some of the earlier comments/ posts actually refers to another school ? What we have found are great teachers and a truly diverse group of seemingly happy kids and parents that care. No bullying which was a major issue up north. This is honestly the best school any of our kids attended, really, compared to schools in NY, NJ and CA.',\n",

The only thing I would change is the fact that you can only take Spanish in you 8th grade year but other than that i give it a thumbs up. It is very diverse and I haven't actually witnessed any bully but there are good people there just a few that always star drama. The dress code is amazing.

The teachers do not have control over the students and some classes have gotten to be a disaster, and we dont get the required learning. Some people say the bulling is all outside the school but the truth is the teachers never pay attention to whats going on in classes, in the cafeteria, in the halls and on the bus. Teachers should try to be less ignorant and pay attention to what is always going on. One last thing is that the age groups should not be mixed. lots of older kids take advantage of the younger ones and it results in bulling which again teachers dont notice. I am at a new school now and i love it. There is not a lot of bulling and if there is any the teachers are very strict about it and solve the problem right away. The counselor is constantly talking to us about bulling and how to prevent it and why.',\n",

I had some amazing teachers that helped shape my life - specifically Mrs. Bretherick who taught me that if you want to do well you have to challenge yourself. Her class was not easy and I was glad for it, as it helped me not only with college, but with life beyond that. Mr. LaFevers taught me the true meaning of compassion and giving. Mr. Hall taught me that no matter how big my dream was, it was attainable as long as I was willing to work towards it. Mr. O'Hara was a great teacher always willing to help if you showed an effort. He brightened my days with his quirky personality and love for science. The office staff and teachers were always willing to help when needed. True, the time between classes could have been a bit longer since the campus is so large, but if you're not socializing you can get to class on time. The clubs and activities are extensive and fun. The cafeteria has some of the best school food I've ever eaten with tons of varieties.\",\n",

       "       'review': \"Simply put, authority in this school is prime focus, classes are uninspired you have 5 minutes to navigate through 150 meters of school ground with 3000 students rushing in the opposite direction you are. Most times, needing to make a stop at your locker to pick up your textbook. Not Because you need it to learn, but because you receive a detention for not bringing it. A second late to class, detention. No exceptions. It is impossible to have a stress free day in this mess. Go to John I. Having gone a year to both schools, John I. by far exceeded expectations. Each and every student is cared for, and not treated rudely the way they would be in pbc. John I. Made me feel like I was important, cared for. They have even referred me to the school therapist to speak one on one. Many of the AP's at John I. Made full effort to help me, while pbc makes me feel as if I am constantly and only ever being watched for mistakes. Don't do this to yourself. Leave it for students who are perfect, because they are the only ones left alone.\",\n",

       "       'review': 'Absolutely ridiculously rude. Teachers and office staff. I am not the biological mother, I am the step mother. My husband works where he can not have his phone. I called to make an appointment for my husband to come in a talk to teacher, the lady who answered phone said in a rude tone when I told her who I was \"I cant talk to you, I need to talk to the father\" I told her that the father had called there at 8am this morning and left a message, no one has returned call. 3 times in last 2 weeks the bus has arrived over an hour late in the afternoon and we have missed out on prepaid classes. You send the teacher asking a couple of questions, so that when we questioned him about the F on a homework assignment we would already know whether it was 1) he didn\\'t bother completing assignment 2)he didn\\'t bother handing in at all or 3) he just had the wrong answers. We question this so we know if its a problem with him not doing work, or if he needs a tudor. He gets punished for not doing his end, but if its honestly something he doesn\\'t grasp, the we would like to get him help. However teachers don\\'t bother answering all the questions, which is not helping us help him.',\n",

The school is more interested in tracking attendance and tardies (3 seconds after bell rings) is considered late..which lands the student a detention. The school has 3000 students, all navigating at once, with stops to lockers between classes in addition to the morning drop off line. More focus on that then teaching. My child has been slammed with detentions..btw no bus after detentions. My child is always stressed out about this. Today I was told by school that they had a full house at the Saturday detention.

It doesnt doesn't matter if you are alumni, a parent, a student, or a soon-to-be student...they treat you horribly. It is built like a prison (I know this because I sat next to one of the architects on a plane from Tampa, who told me they designed it like a prison). I had good teachers, I only have to use one hand to count them. There is a serious lack of trust in the students from ALL staff. I am glad I am out of there. Was I prepared for college? Yes, but that is only because I was in all honors and AP classes. Best of luck to all who will or are going to PBCHS.\",\n",

She is the most kind hearted person! Mrs.Pierce, the school counselor is absolutely amazing. She always has an ear to listen if you need to voice your concerns or want to ask about your child. She will even check up on them if you have a special concern about their well being. She always has a hug and a smile for my son which makes his day. It really means a lot to me how much the school goes out of their way to make you feel important as a parent. My son has had two amazing teachers now, Mrs.Martin in 1st grade who is sweet, kind, and wonderful to all of her students. My son learns so much from her, and loves going to class. He has also had Mrs.Horan in Kindergarten who as her first year at May Howard was stellar! She came in a couple weeks into the school year and my son switched to her class and immediately loved her. She is so peppy and fun! She really loves her students and takes pride in what she does! I highly recommend this school to anyone who is considering moving to this area!\",\n",

I can't imagine why any parent living in the school zone would pay for your kid to go to private school when you can go to the best elementary school for free. My son was an honor roll student here and had wonderful teachers. The only downfall is that the building is very dated and they use a few trailers that need some up keep. They have an after school program for working parents as well. We will miss our children being at this school.\",\n",

The principal is a wonderful woman who cares about her students and her students' parents, and I honestly believe that her enthusiasm and attitude filters down to the teachers and staff. They don't tolerate bad behavior, and my child is bright and confident. I take my child's education VERY seriously, have my finger on the pulse of that school, and must say that I feel very fortunate and blessed that my child attends such a fine educational establishment. Bravo!\",\n",

       "   'review': \"The teachers and staff are dedicated at this school. Both of my children are in the gifted program and it has been amazing. They have tons of science fairs and trades. The school really is advanced in technology and the groups they have created. I wish we were attending it longer but the last two years have been amazing. I think this school should be a 10 and not a 9. Very caring teachers. The community always comes to accomplish fund raisers and support the education of all the children. The military may move us but this school will forever be in our hearts! It is growing and they get more teachers in and keep the classes at the right size (about 18-21 students per class). The teachers assistants are such an equal part in the children lives and we are grateful for their love for the children. They have amazing gardens and picnic tables to have lunch with your students. Communication is daily with the teachers, emails and updates. It is a safe school and they have drop offs made easy in the back of the school. It has been a pleasure attending May Howard. We'll miss this one for sure! Tons of great field trips. It's a wonderful school and everyone will be pleased there.\",\n",

Very bright children (with say an IQ over 130) are not accommodated and when they are bored in class, it is common for teachers to jump on the ADD train. I would NOT recommend this school to anyone who\\'s child fits that criteria or to any parent who thinks \"outside the box\".

My son is an excellent student interested in studying medicine so when we moved to Savannah we were foolish and only looked at what was considered the \"best\" private school here. It was such a disappointment for numerous reasons (I\\'ll save that for another review) that we moved our son to St. Andrew\\'s after the first month of the school year and have never regretted it. My son was immediately welcomed into the St. Andrew\\'s community by peers and by the faculty, and has enjoyed school ever since. My husband and I were impressed with how the school immediately assessed my son\\'s abilities and worked with us to design the perfect curriculum for him that looked not only into freshman year classes but to where he would want to be academically for his senior year. The teachers made themselves available to help him catch up to the other students and have continued to be available both before and after school. I love that St. Andrew\\'s has an amazing curriculum and is also flexible to meet a student\\'s particular interests, it also has excellent college counseling.',\n",

       "     'review': \"In 5th grade, my principal asked me to leave Blessed Sacrament school, as they did not offer a curriculum that was advanced enough to suit my need. Thus, I became enrolled at St. Andrew's and shocked by the new independence granted from thy teachers. The school is unique for the opportunity each student is granted, the opportunity to mold their own educational experience. The school, particularly the extracurriculars, are a product of student demand and initiative. I personally have taken advantage of the freedom, as I formed the first girls cross country team at the school. In doing so I developed my discipline and work ethic so that my idea of a team would become a reality. In its first year, the team consisted of only two members, yet the program has flourished, this year's team finishing as the Runner Up in the GISA State Meet. This single success is indicative of the community as a whole, in which students are given the ability to shape their experience. This privilege is not ignored, but rather flexed by the entirety of the student body, resulting in a passionate, and therefore successful, collection of young adults.\",\n",

       "     'review': \"St. Andrew''s consists of a family aspect and challenging academics. The past few years we have integrated technology into the classroom and this is one of the best decisions St. Andrew''s has ever made. It is important for education to move along with the outside world and 21st teaching/technology. That is exactly what SAS has done and I think it has benefitted everyone in a positive way. St. Andrew''s also uses IB (international baccalaureate) instead of AP. It provides a more challenge to the students, which is what I really look for. We are a small school, which is very beneficial in the classroom. You get one on one time with the teacher, so what appears to be very difficult concepts become a little easier because of the amount of help and extra time we get with the teachers. St. Andrew''s not only has great academics, but we do have a great sports program. We have a no cut policy so anyone and everyone can play any sport they would like. I really like this because it gives each student an opportunity to try something they might not get to at another school. At St. Andrew''s, you tend to eventually know everyone and it brings us a lot closer, which I love about my school.\",\n",

The faculty, staff, and students also engage in activities geared toward global competencies through 21st century teaching and learning and integrated technology. Committed to sustainable practices, the school is an Apple Distinguished institution with iPads and MacBook Airs for all students in grades 5-12 reducing textbook load and paper consumption. Knowledge is built upon skills--collaboration, communication, creativity, critical-thinking and problem-solving, and character. The curriculum focuses on preparing students for a dynamic future rather than static content and as an International Baccalaureate Diploma Program, students ask the \"why\" behind information, routinely get accepted to the highest tier of colleges and universities, and engage as members of a global community. The IB program is HIGHER level and open access. Unlike other local public schools with IB, all students are able to enroll in the IB and the school emphasizes the highest rigor level of the program, rather than the lowest.',\n",

Our 2 lower school children are happy every day to go to Saint Andrews and we are thrilled with their commitment to both a 21st century education and the development of a well rounded person. Looking past the fact that every student gets an IPAD the real benefit to this school is the small community like atmosphere. Familiar and smiling faces abound, children are well cared for, and with the small class sizes our children get the attention they need to succeed. When we moved to Savannah we looked at all the local schools and ended up moving again to Wilmington Island to be near Saint Andrews. If you are looking for a great school in Savannah you would be doing your children a disservice to overlook this school.',\n",

We have just completed our third year at SPA, & I'm even more convinced now, that we made the best choice in choosing SPA! Our teachers are the best out there...their dedication & their love they show to our children & our school is immeasurable. Every day they challenge our children to be the best they can be. The parent involvement at SPA speaks volumes about how important our SPA FAMILY is. My child has blossomed while at SPA...one who started out as a shy child has come into her own...our SPA FAMILY has helped her to achieve that. Our academics at SPA is by far some of the best in Savannah...proven recently by our Terra Nova Scores! We LOVE St. Peter the Apostle Catholic School...and would never hesitate in HIGHLY recommending SPA to other families...just so that they can feel the sense of FAMILY that we have at St. Peter the Apostle Catholic School!!!\",\n",

My eldest graduated from St. Peter's a couple of years ago and he is thriving in high school especially academically. He was recently named into BC's National Honor Society and he continues to enjoy the youth programs offered at St. Peter's. My girls , who are currently attending St. Peter's, are enjoying the competitive sports programs and many faith based afterschool programs such as choir and the rosary club. Academics is top notch and the teachers are wonderful, both dedicated and caring. Faith, friends and family intermingle between the school and parish programs. The community of school and parish offers countless opportunities to learn, volunteer, pray, lead, give, work, socialize and play. St. Peter's is awesome- we are blessed to be a part of it.\",\n",

       "     'review': \"My eight year-old daughter just completed her first year at St. Peter's this May. She had previously been attending public schools within Savannah, and while she had wonderful teachers there, she had a hard time meeting friends. In addition, she lacked a noticeable amount of character and religious education. I am going on my fifth year teaching 9th grade English at one of the local feeder high schools for the Savannah Catholic schools, and my choice of St. Peter's for my child was not only personal but also professional. I knew from past experience that SPA had a dedicated staff, small class sizes, and an appreciable amount of parental involvement. Because I review all of the incoming 9th grade placement tests, I also based my decision that students who have been educated at SPA generally have a significantly stronger foundation in formal & creative writing, reading comprehension, and verbal and language skills. The eighth grade Language Arts teacher, along with their lower and middle school teachers, have obviously done a stellar job in building these essential skills. The 2014 valedictorian and salutatorian were both graduates of SPA, a clear indication of academic strength.\",\n",

We have had two children graduate from SPA who are absolutely thriving in high school and our third child will graduate soon! We love the fact that God is in every classroom at St. Peter's and that the children are taught daily to treat others with care and respect. Each and every student has a prayer partner to lean on and this creates friendships throughout the upper and lower school. It's neat to sometimes see 8th graders holding hands with 4 year olds as they walk along! The teachers at St. Peter's not only challenge their students academically, but they love them unconditionally, this a perfect combination! Our academics are top in the city, proven by recent Terra Nova Scores, and I know that my children are successful students because of our longstanding and dedicated faculty. We love St. Peter the Apostle! http://school.saintpetertheapostle.com/\",\n",

       "     'review': \"Initially, my oldest child began at St. Peter's for Middle School. We loved it so much, we pulled our other two out of their schools and also started them at St. Peter's. They have been here for several years now, and we couldn't be happier. I truly feel that St. Peter's is an extension of our family, and that they are cared for and loved very much. The teachers are wonderful, dedicated teachers and the school is technologically advanced with Smart boards in every classroom, an amazing new computer lab, Spanish beginning in PreK, and Music and Arts as well. The sports program is very competitve (SPAL Champs this year in football and volleyball) and is offered in various forms beginning at the Pre-k level. And of course, most importantly, the Christian atmosphere and religious education is everything my husband and I want for our boys. Fantastic school!\",\n",

My son is in his second year at St. Peters and I would recommend this school to anyone...and I do! I can't wait until my other son is old enough to attend. My son is five years old and comes home each day trying to speak Spanish, attempting complex mathematical ideas (for his age), and exhausted from gym class. He loves this school! The principal, Sister Roberta, is doing tremendous work and is very 'in touch' with the kids. My son sees her everyday and we often get class work that she has graded and signed! With the modern security system in place, I feel secure knowing that my child is being protected. The other parents at St. Peters are wonderful. The teachers are caring and supportive. I just can't say enough about this school!\",\n",

She is the most kind hearted person! Mrs.Pierce, the school counselor is absolutely amazing. She always has an ear to listen if you need to voice your concerns or want to ask about your child. She will even check up on them if you have a special concern about their well being. She always has a hug and a smile for my son which makes his day. It really means a lot to me how much the school goes out of their way to make you feel important as a parent. My son has had two amazing teachers now, Mrs.Martin in 1st grade who is sweet, kind, and wonderful to all of her students. My son learns so much from her, and loves going to class. He has also had Mrs.Horan in Kindergarten who as her first year at May Howard was stellar! She came in a couple weeks into the school year and my son switched to her class and immediately loved her. She is so peppy and fun! She really loves her students and takes pride in what she does! I highly recommend this school to anyone who is considering moving to this area!\",\n",

I can't imagine why any parent living in the school zone would pay for your kid to go to private school when you can go to the best elementary school for free. My son was an honor roll student here and had wonderful teachers. The only downfall is that the building is very dated and they use a few trailers that need some up keep. They have an after school program for working parents as well. We will miss our children being at this school.\",\n",

The school really is advanced in technology and the groups they have created. I wish we were attending it longer but the last two years have been amazing. I think this school should be a 10 and not a 9. Very caring teachers. The community always comes to accomplish fund raisers and support the education of all the children. The military may move us but this school will forever be in our hearts! It is growing and they get more teachers in and keep the classes at the right size (about 18-21 students per class). The teachers assistants are such an equal part in the children lives and we are grateful for their love for the children. They have amazing gardens and picnic tables to have lunch with your students. Communication is daily with the teachers, emails and updates. It is a safe school and they have drop offs made easy in the back of the school. It has been a pleasure attending May Howard. We'll miss this one for sure! Tons of great field trips. It's a wonderful school and everyone will be pleased there.\",\n",

The teachers are rude, unfriendly, and do not provide the nurturing and exciting environment a young elementary school student should have. Our son will NOT be attending Marshpoint next year. My husband and I have bit the bullet and are paying for private school after this horrifying experience.

However I have experienced a hyper-controlling atmosphere with teachers - younger and older teachers alike- yelling and threatening kids without merit. The music in the lunchroom mandates silence - no talking whatsoever - why are they discouraging kids from learning such an important social skill - communication - kids are threatened with loss of recess should they speak while the music blares at lunch or they are placed at a desk facing the wall. There is a constant \"shhhhhhh\" during the lunch period (which should be a time to unwind). Teachers continue to yell at the kids to stand in line, three blocks from the wall and again lose recess time if the teacher determines them not to be standing at attention adequately. I directly witnessed yelling by staff at kids for absolutely no reason. It felt as if they were so unsure of their own abilities they felt the need to spread fear and intimidation to manage their own issues. All of this goes unchecked. We reported the threats of recess lost to the principal and her solution was to send out a memo.',\n",

This school presently carries a score of 8. It is one of the most un nurturing environments which touts itself as a school of excellence. A facade. We toured the school and were impressed. It wasn't until I dressed down/ indiscript, and wandered the lunchroom and halls that I witnessed what I saw and heard. This school scores at best a 2 because there is truly no nurturing which takes place and the yelling and excessive control is nothing short of damaging. How can children possibly grow their minds when they are told to shut them and tow a very narrow line of simple obedience without any curiosity and love of learning playing a role in the process? The principal should be ashamed. She touts something her school is not. Like I said I witnessed it first hand. On several occasions, several classrooms and not just the ones my children are in. My kids told me stories I didn't want to believe and then I experienced them.\",\n",

Issues that were brought to the attention of the school were not handled properly either. When I went in to transfer, top level administration was rude and unwilling to help.

My son is an excellent student interested in studying medicine so when we moved to Savannah we were foolish and only looked at what was considered the \"best\" private school here. It was such a disappointment for numerous reasons (I\\'ll save that for another review) that we moved our son to St. Andrew\\'s after the first month of the school year and have never regretted it. My son was immediately welcomed into the St. Andrew\\'s community by peers and by the faculty, and has enjoyed school ever since. My husband and I were impressed with how the school immediately assessed my son\\'s abilities and worked with us to design the perfect curriculum for him that looked not only into freshman year classes but to where he would want to be academically for his senior year. The teachers made themselves available to help him catch up to the other students and have continued to be available both before and after school. I love that St. Andrew\\'s has an amazing curriculum and is also flexible to meet a student\\'s particular interests, it also has excellent college counseling.',\n",

       "     'review': \"In 5th grade, my principal asked me to leave Blessed Sacrament school, as they did not offer a curriculum that was advanced enough to suit my need. Thus, I became enrolled at St. Andrew's and shocked by the new independence granted from thy teachers. The school is unique for the opportunity each student is granted, the opportunity to mold their own educational experience. The school, particularly the extracurriculars, are a product of student demand and initiative. I personally have taken advantage of the freedom, as I formed the first girls cross country team at the school. In doing so I developed my discipline and work ethic so that my idea of a team would become a reality. In its first year, the team consisted of only two members, yet the program has flourished, this year's team finishing as the Runner Up in the GISA State Meet. This single success is indicative of the community as a whole, in which students are given the ability to shape their experience. This privilege is not ignored, but rather flexed by the entirety of the student body, resulting in a passionate, and therefore successful, collection of young adults.\",\n",

       "     'review': \"St. Andrew''s consists of a family aspect and challenging academics. The past few years we have integrated technology into the classroom and this is one of the best decisions St. Andrew''s has ever made. It is important for education to move along with the outside world and 21st teaching/technology. That is exactly what SAS has done and I think it has benefitted everyone in a positive way. St. Andrew''s also uses IB (international baccalaureate) instead of AP. It provides a more challenge to the students, which is what I really look for. We are a small school, which is very beneficial in the classroom. You get one on one time with the teacher, so what appears to be very difficult concepts become a little easier because of the amount of help and extra time we get with the teachers. St. Andrew''s not only has great academics, but we do have a great sports program. We have a no cut policy so anyone and everyone can play any sport they would like. I really like this because it gives each student an opportunity to try something they might not get to at another school. At St. Andrew''s, you tend to eventually know everyone and it brings us a lot closer, which I love about my school.\",\n",

The faculty, staff, and students also engage in activities geared toward global competencies through 21st century teaching and learning and integrated technology.

Knowledge is built upon skills--collaboration, communication, creativity, critical-thinking and problem-solving, and character. The curriculum focuses on preparing students for a dynamic future rather than static content and as an International Baccalaureate Diploma Program, students ask the \"why\" behind information, routinely get accepted to the highest tier of colleges and universities, and engage as members of a global community. The IB program is HIGHER level and open access. Unlike other local public schools with IB, all students are able to enroll in the IB and the school emphasizes the highest rigor level of the program, rather than the lowest.',\n",

Our 2 lower school children are happy every day to go to Saint Andrews and we are thrilled with their commitment to both a 21st century education and the development of a well rounded person. Looking past the fact that every student gets an IPAD the real benefit to this school is the small community like atmosphere. Familiar and smiling faces abound, children are well cared for, and with the small class sizes our children get the attention they need to succeed. When we moved to Savannah we looked at all the local schools and ended up moving again to Wilmington Island to be near Saint Andrews. If you are looking for a great school in Savannah you would be doing your children a disservice to overlook this school.',\n",

       "     'review': \"My eight year-old daughter just completed her first year at St. Peter's this May. She had previously been attending public schools within Savannah, and while she had wonderful teachers there, she had a hard time meeting friends. In addition, she lacked a noticeable amount of character and religious education. I am going on my fifth year teaching 9th grade English at one of the local feeder high schools for the Savannah Catholic schools, and my choice of St. Peter's for my child was not only personal but also professional. I knew from past experience that SPA had a dedicated staff, small class sizes, and an appreciable amount of parental involvement. Because I review all of the incoming 9th grade placement tests, I also based my decision that students who have been educated at SPA generally have a significantly stronger foundation in formal & creative writing, reading comprehension, and verbal and language skills. The eighth grade Language Arts teacher, along with their lower and middle school teachers, have obviously done a stellar job in building these essential skills. The 2014 valedictorian and salutatorian were both graduates of SPA, a clear indication of academic strength.\",\n",

The school is getting a brand new playground for next year. The class sizes are small which is great! They have a up-to-date Computer Lab and student computers in each classroom.

       "     'review': \"St. Peter the Apostle Catholic School is a treasured place in our family. We have had two children graduate from SPA who are absolutely thriving in high school and our third child will graduate soon! We love the fact that God is in every classroom at St. Peter's and that the children are taught daily to treat others with care and respect. Each and every student has a prayer partner to lean on and this creates friendships throughout the upper and lower school. It's neat to sometimes see 8th graders holding hands with 4 year olds as they walk along! The teachers at St. Peter's not only challenge their students academically, but they love them unconditionally, this a perfect combination! Our academics are top in the city, proven by recent Terra Nova Scores, and I know that my children are successful students because of our longstanding and dedicated faculty. We love St. Peter the Apostle! http://school.saintpetertheapostle.com/\",\n",

First, I received a threatening letter about his attendance, had to take a day off and \"meet\" with this \"knowledgeable\" group of nitwits. I reported this \"letter\" to the board and they were reprimanded. Second, my son was sent away at lunch in tears because they would not accept a check for payment towards his lunch account. Third, the language taught in 6th grade is Chinese. Good Lord, please. My kid is fluent in both German and Dutch. Let\\'s try a language that he could use and maybe build on. Third, I just overall hate this county. Island schools are the best of the worst in this county, but to do it again, I would have never come here. If you have the unfortunate fortune of having to move to Chatham County, I suggest Private Schools. On the Island, any of the Catholic Schools or St. Andrew\\'s. In town, again, any Catholic School, Calvary, and maybe Savannah Christian. But Savannah Christian would be my last choice. Very stuck up. If possible, live and put your children in Bryan County or Effingham County Schools. Chatham County is broken and that is coming from a product of it. They have ruined it. Don\\'t let it ruin your children.',\n",

The school provides excellent communication with weekly emails, texts, tweets, and daily website updates. Academics are challenging. Many students leave 8th grade with high school credits. There are a wide variety of activities for all interests. The band, chorus, and athletics departments are all top notch. PTA is very active. Most of the teachers are caring. The faculty and administrative strive to offer a nurturing environment during the challenging middle school years. Discipline is strict and campus police are responsive to any issues.

It was such a disappointment for numerous reasons (I\\'ll save that for another review) that we moved our son to St. Andrew\\'s after the first month of the school year and have never regretted it. My son was immediately welcomed into the St. Andrew\\'s community by peers and by the faculty, and has enjoyed school ever since. My husband and I were impressed with how the school immediately assessed my son\\'s abilities and worked with us to design the perfect curriculum for him that looked not only into freshman year classes but to where he would want to be academically for his senior year. The teachers made themselves available to help him catch up to the other students and have continued to be available both before and after school. I love that St. Andrew\\'s has an amazing curriculum and is also flexible to meet a student\\'s particular interests, it also has excellent college counseling.',\n",

Thus, I became enrolled at St. Andrew's and shocked by the new independence granted from thy teachers. The school is unique for the opportunity each student is granted, the opportunity to mold their own educational experience. The school, particularly the extracurriculars, are a product of student demand and initiative. I personally have taken advantage of the freedom, as I formed the first girls cross country team at the school. In doing so I developed my discipline and work ethic so that my idea of a team would become a reality. In its first year, the team consisted of only two members, yet the program has flourished, this year's team finishing as the Runner Up in the GISA State Meet. This single success is indicative of the community as a whole, in which students are given the ability to shape their experience. This privilege is not ignored, but rather flexed by the entirety of the student body, resulting in a passionate, and therefore successful, collection of young adults.\",\n",

       "     'review': \"St. Andrew''s consists of a family aspect and challenging academics. The past few years we have integrated technology into the classroom and this is one of the best decisions St. Andrew''s has ever made. It is important for education to move along with the outside world and 21st teaching/technology. That is exactly what SAS has done and I think it has benefitted everyone in a positive way. St. Andrew''s also uses IB (international baccalaureate) instead of AP. It provides a more challenge to the students, which is what I really look for. We are a small school, which is very beneficial in the classroom. You get one on one time with the teacher, so what appears to be very difficult concepts become a little easier because of the amount of help and extra time we get with the teachers. St. Andrew''s not only has great academics, but we do have a great sports program. We have a no cut policy so anyone and everyone can play any sport they would like. I really like this because it gives each student an opportunity to try something they might not get to at another school. At St. Andrew''s, you tend to eventually know everyone and it brings us a lot closer, which I love about my school.\",\n",

Our 2 lower school children are happy every day to go to Saint Andrews and we are thrilled with their commitment to both a 21st century education and the development of a well rounded person. Looking past the fact that every student gets an IPAD the real benefit to this school is the small community like atmosphere. Familiar and smiling faces abound, children are well cared for, and with the small class sizes our children get the attention they need to succeed. When we moved to Savannah we looked at all the local schools and ended up moving again to Wilmington Island to be near Saint Andrews.

It really means a lot to me how much the school goes out of their way to make you feel important as a parent. My son has had two amazing teachers now, Mrs.Martin in 1st grade who is sweet, kind, and wonderful to all of her students. My son learns so much from her, and loves going to class. He has also had Mrs.Horan in Kindergarten who as her first year at May Howard was stellar! She came in a couple weeks into the school year and my son switched to her class and immediately loved her.

The teachers assistants are such an equal part in the children lives and we are grateful for their love for the children. They have amazing gardens and picnic tables to have lunch with your students. Communication is daily with the teachers, emails and updates. It is a safe school and they have drop offs made easy in the back of the school. It has been a pleasure attending May Howard. We'll miss this one for sure! Tons of great field trips. It's a wonderful school and everyone will be pleased there.\",\n",

Very bright children (with say an IQ over 130) are not accommodated and when they are bored in class, it is common for teachers to jump on the ADD train. I would NOT recommend this school to anyone who\\'s child fits that criteria or to any parent who thinks \"outside the box\". We will be switching to Tybee Island Maritime Academy for the upcoming school year.',\n",

I reported this \"letter\" to the board and they were reprimanded. Second, my son was sent away at lunch in tears because they would not accept a check for payment towards his lunch account. Third, the language taught in 6th grade is Chinese. Good Lord, please. My kid is fluent in both German and Dutch. Let\\'s try a language that he could use and maybe build on. Third, I just overall hate this county. Island schools are the best of the worst in this county, but to do it again, I would have never come here. If you have the unfortunate fortune of having to move to Chatham County, I suggest Private Schools. On the Island, any of the Catholic Schools or St. Andrew\\'s. In town, again, any Catholic School, Calvary, and maybe Savannah Christian. But Savannah Christian would be my last choice. Very stuck up. If possible, live and put your children in Bryan County or Effingham County Schools. Chatham County is broken and that is coming from a product of it. They have ruined it.

She will even check up on them if you have a special concern about their well being. She always has a hug and a smile for my son which makes his day. It really means a lot to me how much the school goes out of their way to make you feel important as a parent. My son has had two amazing teachers now, Mrs.Martin in 1st grade who is sweet, kind, and wonderful to all of her students. My son learns so much from her, and loves going to class. He has also had Mrs.Horan in Kindergarten who as her first year at May Howard was stellar! She came in a couple weeks into the school year and my son switched to her class and immediately loved her. She is so peppy and fun! She really loves her students and takes pride in what she does! I highly recommend this school to anyone who is considering moving to this area!\",\n",

       "     'review': \"The teachers and staff are dedicated at this school. Both of my children are in the gifted program and it has been amazing. They have tons of science fairs and trades. The school really is advanced in technology and the groups they have created. I wish we were attending it longer but the last two years have been amazing. I think this school should be a 10 and not a 9. Very caring teachers. The community always comes to accomplish fund raisers and support the education of all the children. The military may move us but this school will forever be in our hearts! It is growing and they get more teachers in and keep the classes at the right size (about 18-21 students per class). The teachers assistants are such an equal part in the children lives and we are grateful for their love for the children. They have amazing gardens and picnic tables to have lunch with your students. Communication is daily with the teachers, emails and updates. It is a safe school and they have drop offs made easy in the back of the school. It has been a pleasure attending May Howard. We'll miss this one for sure! Tons of great field trips. It's a wonderful school and everyone will be pleased there.\",\n",

Very bright children (with say an IQ over 130) are not accommodated and when they are bored in class, it is common for teachers to jump on the ADD train. I would NOT recommend this school to anyone who\\'s child fits that criteria or to any parent who thinks \"outside the box\".

I reported this \"letter\" to the board and they were reprimanded. Second, my son was sent away at lunch in tears because they would not accept a check for payment towards his lunch account. Third, the language taught in 6th grade is Chinese. Good Lord, please. My kid is fluent in both German and Dutch. Let\\'s try a language that he could use and maybe build on. Third, I just overall hate this county. Island schools are the best of the worst in this county, but to do it again, I would have never come here. If you have the unfortunate fortune of having to move to Chatham County, I suggest Private Schools. On the Island, any of the Catholic Schools or St. Andrew\\'s. In town, again, any Catholic School, Calvary, and maybe Savannah Christian. But Savannah Christian would be my last choice. Very stuck up. If possible, live and put your children in Bryan County or Effingham County Schools. Chatham County is broken and that is coming from a product of it. They have ruined it.

She is intrigued by the teachers, and feels excited to go every morning. The school is the home of a Biological Sciences program, which is also one of the most academically challenging magnet programs available in the entire school system. Although the school might be short on history, the structure of the place has been well designed and executed. We are optimistic about the future of our children's experiences at Islands High School.\",\n",

Its a joke honestly, where i was from in the northeast, my 6th grade year was more challenging from my one year experience with these slackers. The wost.part is, there isnt even soap in the bathrooms. Im sure the schools being built in Africa offer a better education than this circus. An abosolute joke of a school. Its a shame kids dont recieve a proper opportunity to learn, and this is coming from a one year 10th grade student.',\n",

The coursework is rigorous and well taught. I have seen my daughter's comprehension and retention of material skyrocket in her first year out of middle school. She is intrigued by the teachers, and feels excited to go every morning. The school is the home of a Biological Sciences program, which is also one of the most academically challenging magnet programs available in the entire school system. Although the school might be short on history, the structure of the place has been well designed and executed. We are optimistic about the future of our children's experiences at Islands High School.\",\n",

I was very skeptical at first, but after a few short weeks I realized this was the BEST place for my child! There is almost 1:1 attention/learning. The ladies in this program are all wonderful & have so much patience and tolerance! If your child struggles with behavior issues (even severe behavior challenges), I HIGHLY recommend reaching out and asking your child’s school about the program. Kids just need to be in the 23j school district to attend (I believe).',\n",

The environment is very conducive to learning and the staff are very good at their jobs. In most years the parent volunteer rate at Mary Woodward is very good as well and I think that's extremely important to the success of students and teaching staff. It's a team effort or you could say it takes a village to raise a child and give them the best chance at success academically and in life.\",\n",

I will not be sending my children back to this school next year. If you're new to the area- check into some of the other schools that aren't dominated by a small group of parents who will see to it that your child will not fit in as an outsider.\",\n",

       "       'review': 'We love Mary Woodward! The teachers are supportive and fair, and the parents are heavily involved. We have full day kindergarten as an option, fun field trips, music programs, science fair, cultural fair, Art Lit, afterschool classes, and our beloved garden! There are just two big fundraisers, the Jogathon and Spring Auction. We have many learning specialists, TAG, and a parent supported library. Each grade has special projects and programs that parents can visit and attend. Our fifth graders can participate in an Ambassadors program to volunteer in special charity projects and the student store, promoting leadership. There are \"buddy\" links for classes of different grades to help everyone meet friends of all ages. I am surprised to hear about bullying, because that is certainly not the culture of the school, each student is encouraged to be respectful and work out their differences fairly. I feel so lucky that my children are able to attend this great school!',\n",

What ever happened to equal human rights? I wouldn't speak to an ant like that... It's very troublesome to me. She has been like that ever since we first stepped foot into the school 5 years ago and it's never gotten better! The principal allows bullying because they have yet to reprimand students for punching other children in the face, etc. You'd think there would be a serious consequence for that but unfortunately not. The class sizes are insanely HUGE and they keep allowing out of district students in for various absurd reasons (we don't care who you are, go in your own district or go private, people). Makes it hard for the students who are supposed to be there to really learn because they aren't getting adequate attention. The whole school is a total joke. It honestly has been a miserable experience from day one! They need better staff, especially in the front office, and they need to focus on the children's needs because they certainly aren't being met!\",\n",

We started here because they offered full day kindergarten we are staying because of the love and attention the teachers and faculty show towards each student. Our daughter has grown into a relationship with God through school and that fire has spread into our home life. She brought God back into our home. She is learning new things and actually became extremely upset when we had to keep her home from school because she was sick. I have not met a child so passionate about learning. I compared her education to my neices and my daughter was significantly ahead academically. The staff know the parents and parents know the staff. The close community environment is reassuring that your child is not just a face in the crowd. I cannot say enough good things about the school, church or faculty. Shannon Glineck',\n",

Our daughter has grown into a relationship with God through school and that fire has spread into our home life. She brought God back into our home. She is learning new things and actually became extremely upset when we had to keep her home from school because she was sick. I have not met a child so passionate about learning. I compared her education to my neices and my daughter was significantly ahead academically. The staff know the parents and parents know the staff. The close community environment is reassuring that your child is not just a face in the crowd. I cannot say enough good things about the school, church or faculty. Shannon Glineck',\n",

One of my favorite parts was being apart of a class called peer tutoring. A program in which students had the opportunity to work with special needs students in a classroom setting which was always the favorite part of my day. At the end of eighth grade I recieved several awards which I still carry with me in pride. I made so many amazing friends and there was not one teacher I didn't like. I felt like I could go to any cousler or teacher if I ever needed help with anything, family, school, etc. I will only have amazing memories of fowler that have influenced how I am even today.

A nameless few are just rude, but nearly all of mine were cheerful and helpful and wanted nothing more than to see the students succeed. The counselors were also great. They were very kind and understanding, and helped in any way they could. The principal was extremely enthusiastic and talked to/got to know the students. The school was the best up-kept I've ever attended. Many of the students were rude and liked to pick on people, though, but that's sort of inevitable.\",\n",

You can tell they truly love what they do and love the children. As far as a preschool goes, the staff does a great job juggling academics with fun. They are able to find fun projects that really help each child grow and learn. The staff does a great job encouraging and developing the whole child, not just the academic part. They encourage respect for all things, include each other. They have their own private play yard with equipment that is the appropriate size for the children's age.

       "       'review': 'My daughter started at Southridge as a freshman. I have to say, my opinion of the school is not great. My daughter has always been very motivated, and done well at school. However, she really struggled at Southridge. At first I chalked it up to adjusting to a different school.....She had a hard time keeping up in class and the most frustrating part was the teachers lack of help. She had no problem asking the teachers for help, but she was almost always met with \"that\\'s something you learned last year\" (how they know what she learned last year or not is beyond me. I guess they made the assumption that EVERY child in Southridge went to the exact same school for junior high.We had just moved from out of state), or \"we\\'ll go over it later\" (later never came). It was very difficult seeing my daughter try so hard, yet have absolutely no help...Another issue we had was bullying. The kids were extremely mean to my daughter, but the worse part was the lack of any action on the part of the teachers. Kids would loudly embarrass my daughter in front of the whole class, and instead of a teacher stepping in, they would pacify the student who was bullying and embarrassing my daughter.',\n",

The ladies in this program are all wonderful & have so much patience and tolerance!

I will not be sending my children back to this school next year. If you're new to the area- check into some of the other schools that aren't dominated by a small group of parents who will see to it that your child will not fit in as an outsider.\",\n",

I have great memories of reading in the garden as well as admiring its beauty. I loved being an ambassador in fifth grade and helping out the younger kids. I loved everyone of my teachers and felt loved throughout all my five years. I am a sophomore in high school now and only have fond memories.',\n",

       "       'review': 'We love Mary Woodward! The teachers are supportive and fair, and the parents are heavily involved. We have full day kindergarten as an option, fun field trips, music programs, science fair, cultural fair, Art Lit, afterschool classes, and our beloved garden! There are just two big fundraisers, the Jogathon and Spring Auction. We have many learning specialists, TAG, and a parent supported library. Each grade has special projects and programs that parents can visit and attend. Our fifth graders can participate in an Ambassadors program to volunteer in special charity projects and the student store, promoting leadership. There are \"buddy\" links for classes of different grades to help everyone meet friends of all ages. I am surprised to hear about bullying, because that is certainly not the culture of the school, each student is encouraged to be respectful and work out their differences fairly. I feel so lucky that my children are able to attend this great school!',\n",

One of my favorite parts was being apart of a class called peer tutoring. A program in which students had the opportunity to work with special needs students in a classroom setting which was always the favorite part of my day. At the end of eighth grade I recieved several awards which I still carry with me in pride. I made so many amazing friends and there was not one teacher I didn't like. I felt like I could go to any cousler or teacher if I ever needed help with anything, family, school, etc. I will only have amazing memories of fowler that have influenced how I am even today.

The ladies in this program are all wonderful & have so much patience and tolerance! If your child struggles with behavior issues (even severe behavior challenges), I HIGHLY recommend reaching out and asking your child’s school about the program.

       "       'review': \"This is honestly the most amazing school. I was able to be apart of so many wonderful opportunities at this school. One of my favorite parts was being apart of a class called peer tutoring. A program in which students had the opportunity to work with special needs students in a classroom setting which was always the favorite part of my day. At the end of eighth grade I recieved several awards which I still carry with me in pride. I made so many amazing friends and there was not one teacher I didn't like. I felt like I could go to any cousler or teacher if I ever needed help with anything, family, school, etc. I will only have amazing memories of fowler that have influenced how I am even today. Thanks Fowler.\",\n",
